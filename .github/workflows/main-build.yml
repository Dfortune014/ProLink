# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# MAIN BRANCH BUILD VALIDATION
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
#   Validate application integrity after security
#   approval and successful merge into main.
#
# What This Workflow Does:
#   - Installs application dependencies
#   - Runs linting checks (FAILS on errors)
#   - Builds production artifacts
#   - Publishes build outputs as artifacts
#
# What This Workflow Does NOT Do:
#   - No security scanning
#   - No secret access beyond build-time variables
#   - No deployment
#
# Trust Boundary:
#   Post-merge / Pre-deployment
#
# Rationale:
#   Security enforcement occurs before merge.
#   This workflow assumes code has already passed
#   security gates and focuses solely on build correctness.
